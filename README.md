🧠 I’m passionate about modeling market behavior — building simulations, studying heavy tails, and finding structure in uncertainty.  
🚀 Currently creating **finr**, a finance research library focused on heavy tails, fBM, and options.  
☕ When I’m not coding, you’ll find me enjoying a good coffee, new ideas, and calm markets.  
📈 You can also find me on <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/">TradingView</a>, where I share insights and trading ideas.
