### 🚀 About Me  
I’m a Quantitative Researcher & Data Scientist passionate about turning mathematical ideas into real trading strategies.  
My main goal is to **leverage the knowledge and tools I’ve built to generate consistent profits from the market** 💰💰💰 — combining research, data, and disciplined execution.
I focus on **quantitative modeling**, **market behavior**, and **algorithmic trading systems**

🧩 Love working on:  
- Quantitative modeling & stochastic processes  
- Algorithmic trading systems & market simulations
- Discovering interesting insights hidden in market data 📊
- Studying **power-law behavior** to better understand extreme movements in stocks 📉

### 💡 Projects  
- **finr** — Python library for finance research (tails, fBM, Hurst, options)  
- **Option-Chain** — Streamlit app for options analytics  
- **Thesis** — Power-law tails with exponential cutoff (LION Method)

### 🎓 MSc Thesis  
My master’s thesis focused on **characterizing power-law distributions in financial markets** and improving parameter estimation methods for heavy-tailed data.  
I developed the **LION method**, a resampling-based framework that enhances the robustness and accuracy of tail exponent estimation compared to the classical approaches.
